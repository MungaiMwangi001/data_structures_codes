# question 1

we can create a class that efficiently supports the following operations:

Insert a value without duplicates.
Remove a value.
Get a random value with equal probability.

To achieve this, we can use a combination of:
A hash map (dictionary) for 𝑂(1)
O(1) insertion and deletion by tracking element indices.
A dynamic array (list) for 𝑂(1)
O(1) random access to elements.


# remove an element in a data structure in constant time
To remove an element from a data structure in constant time (
𝑂(1)
O(1)), the data structure must support direct access to the element. The most common data structures that allow this are:

1. Hash Table (or Hash Set)
Requirement: You have a hash table or hash set.
How it works: If the element to remove is already known (and hashable), you can directly access and remove it using its hash key in constant time.
Example in Python (using a set):

python
Copy code
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4}
my_set.remove(3)  # O(1) operation
2. Doubly Linked List with Hash Map
Requirement: Combine a doubly linked list with a hash map (or hash table). The hash map stores pointers (or references) to the nodes in the doubly linked list.
How it works: Use the hash map to find the node in 
𝑂
(
1
)
O(1) and remove it from the linked list in 
𝑂
(
1
)
O(1) by updating the pointers.
Example structure:

Hash Map: {value: node_reference}
Doubly Linked List: Supports direct removal via node pointers.
3. Dynamic Array with Index Hash Map
Requirement: Combine a dynamic array with a hash map. The hash map stores the index of each element in the array.
How it works: Use the hash map to find the index of the element to be removed in 
𝑂
(
1
)
O(1). Replace the element with the last element in the array and update the hash map. Then, remove the last element from the array in 
𝑂(1)
O(1).
Example process:

python
Copy code
array = [10, 20, 30]
index_map = {10: 0, 20: 1, 30: 2}

# Remove 20
index_to_remove = index_map[20]
last_element = array[-1]

# Swap with the last element
array[index_to_remove] = last_element
index_map[last_element] = index_to_remove

# Remove the last element
array.pop()
index_map.pop(20)
Key Points:
Constant-time removal requires an efficient way to locate the element, which usually involves an auxiliary data structure like a hash map.
Data structures like heaps or binary search trees do not support 
𝑂(1)
O(1) removal because searching for the element takes longer.
